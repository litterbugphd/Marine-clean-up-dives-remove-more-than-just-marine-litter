#Biomass Master Doc Workflow 
-contains excel workbook with tidy (parameter measurements), glance (goodness of fit metrics), and augment (model-level augmented predictions and diagnostics) outputs used to determine biomass models for each taxa with broom R package. 

#Biomass Medians Complete 
-contains medians, means, confidence intervals, sd, se, quartile, max, and min for taxa data used to create biomass models. 

#Equation Results Clean 
-contains weight measures for all taxa using median or biomass models for all taxa found on the 18 observed marine debris dives.

#Sensitivy test plot
-Sensitivity of total biomass estimates to the minimum sample size required for applying length and width–weight relationships. Total biomass was calculated across a range of minimum sample-size cutoffs for applying length-weight and width-weight relationships (black line). For each cutoff, relationships were applied only when the taxon-specific sample size met or exceeded the cutoff and the equation could be evaluated successfully; all other observations used median mass values. The red horizontal line indicates total biomass estimated using median values only. Biomass estimates were highly sensitive to allowing relationships at very small sample sizes (n < ~7) but stabilized rapidly at higher cutoffs, indicating robustness of biomass estimates across a wide range of conservative thresholds.
